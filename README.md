# Cluecards

<https://clue.adamts.me>

Automatic inference for interactions in [Clue (Cluedo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).

## How does it work?

If you're interested in a written explanation for the inference methods I've discovered while creating this website,
I've done my best to document them [here](./Inference.md).
You don't need to read it to use the website, but it might be interesting.

Note that GitLab has a maximum number of LaTeX cells per markdown file,
so it will not display properly unless you're looking at this repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/MysteryBlokHed/cluecards).
